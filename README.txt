This is a collection of small scripts for ett.
They depend on ltlporpgt/eyebot libs like tikolutool.

They are intended more as convenience tools for general use.

====FEATURES====

pagemon:

PageMonitor is a tool that allows you to monitor the activity
of multiple pages on ett. You can use this to monitor your own
pages to prevent griefing, monitor chatrooms to know when you
have a reply, etc.

====NOTES====
This code consists of mostly untested adaptations of much better code.
So, there may be some bugs that I don't have in my version but which exist here.
Please keep this in mind.
